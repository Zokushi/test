# Cursed Compass Development Roadmap - Hotel Booking Platform

## Vision Shift: From Haunted Locations to Hotel Booking Platform
**New Direction**: Building a hotel availability scraper and booking platform starting with Jerome Grand Hotel

## Current Progress - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! 🚀
- ✅ Set up basic application structure (React frontend, Express backend)
- ✅ Implemented basic ORM for database management
- ✅ Created basic location viewing functionality
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ Created seed data with location structure
- ✅ **COMPLETE JEROME GRAND INTEGRATION** - End-to-end working!
- ✅ **Real room scraping** with prices, availability, descriptions
- ✅ **Beautiful booking UI** with date picker and guest selector
- ✅ **Featured hotel on homepage** with live data
- ✅ **Full frontend → backend → scraper pipeline**

## CURRENT PRIORITY: Multi-Hotel Platform & Payment Integration

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (After Tonight's Success):
1. **Add 2nd Hotel Scraper** (The Shining Hotel - Stanley Hotel)
2. **Room Photos & Assets** - Make it look professional
3. **Stripe Payment Integration** - Make bookings functional  
4. **Testing & Polish** - End-to-end booking flow

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SETUP REQUIREMENTS (Run EVERY Time Before Starting):

**Before running `npm run dev`, ALWAYS run these Prisma commands:**
```bash
# From the root directory:
cd backend
npx prisma generate    # Generate Prisma client (required for imports)
npx prisma migrate deploy    # Apply any pending database migrations
cd ..
npm run dev    # NOW you can start the servers
```

**Why This is Critical:**
- Without `prisma generate`, backend crashes with: `Module '@prisma/client' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'`
- This regenerates the TypeScript client from the schema
- Must be run after any schema changes or fresh installs
